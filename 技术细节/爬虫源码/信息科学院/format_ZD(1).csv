Algorithms for polynomial selection in the number field sieve,Dr Shi Bai (白石),2015-12-25,信工所3号楼3224会议室,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201512/t20151223_320358.html,none,"The general number field sieve (GNFS) is the most efficient algorithm known for factoring large integers. It consists of several stages, the first one being the polynomial selection. The running-time of the number field sieve depends on the quality of the chosen polynomials. The quality of the chosen polynomials can be modeled in terms of size and root properties. In this talk, we will describe some better algorithms to select polynomials with good size and root properties.",Dr Shi Bai is a postdoctoral research fellow at Ecole Normale Superieure Lyon.

Time--Memory Trade-off Attack on the GSM A5/1 Stream Cipher Using Commodity GPGPU,吕继强,2015-12-24,中科院信息工程所3号楼3224会议室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201512/t20151218_319948.html,none,"Time--memory trade-off (TMTO) cryptanalysis is a powerful technique for practically breaking a variety of security systems in reality. There are mainly four general TMTO cryptanalysis methods, namely Hellman table cryptanalysis, rainbow table cryptanalysis, thin rainbow table cryptanalysis and thick rainbow table cryptanalysis, plus a few supplementary techniques that can be combined with a general method to produce possibly distinct TMTOs, like distinguished points. In this talk, we present a unified TMTO cryptanalysis, which we call unified rainbow table cryptanalysis, basing it on a unified rainbow table, then we describe its general combination with distinguished points, and finally we apply unified rainbow table cryptanalysis to the A5/1 stream cipher being used in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). On a general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) computer with 3 NVIDIA GeForce GTX690 cards that cost about 15,000 United States dollars in total, we made a unified rainbow table of 984GB in about 55 days, and implemented a unified rainbow table attack that had an online attack time of 9 seconds with a success probability of 34% (or 56%) when using 4 (respectively, 8) known keystreams (of 114 bits long each). If two such tables of 984GB were generated, the attack would have an online attack time of 9 seconds with a success probability of 81% when using 8 known keystreams. The practical results show again that nowadays A5/1 is rather insecure in reality and GSM should no longer use it.","吕继强2000年本科毕业于烟台大学应用数学专业,2003年硕士毕业于西安电子科技大学通信与信息系统专业,2008年博士毕业于英国Royal Holloway, University of London信息安全专业。他先后在荷兰Eindhoven University of Technology和法国Ecole Normale Superieure从事博士后工作，目前是新加坡咨询通信研究院的科研人员。他的研究领域主要是对称密码学和相关的信息安全。"
Storage side channel attacks in modern OS and network stacks,"Dr. Zhiyun Qian (University of California, Riverside)",2015-12-10,中国科学院信息工程研究所3号楼3224室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201512/t20151207_317899.html,none,"In this talk, I will introduce a class of practical storage side channel attacks against the Android OS and the TCP stacks. They lead to significant damage to user privacy, network security, application integrity. The attack in Android allows a background app to infer what the foreground app is doing without requiring any permission. Knowing the state of the foreground app, we are then able to hijack the foreground app and launch phishing attacks to steal sensitive information such as passwords and bank account info. The attack in TCP stacks allows an off-path attacker on the Internet to hijack TCP connections created between a legitimate client and server. For instance, we are able to hijack the browsers connection to facebook and replace it with a phishing login page to steal credentials. Prompted by our work, corresponding vendors (e.g., Checkpoint, Linux kernel) have proposed mitigation solutions and applied patches.","Dr. Zhiyun Qian is an assistant professor at University of California, Riverside.

Every Second Counts: Quantifying the Negative Externalities of Cybercrime via Typosquatting,Dr. Zhou Li (RSA Labs),2015-11-23,中国科学院信息工程研究所3号楼3224室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201511/t20151118_315663.html,none,"We present a strategy for quantifying the harm caused by the cybercrime of typosquatting via the novel technique of intent inference. Intent inference allows us to define a new metric for quantifying harm to users, develop a new methodology for identifying typosquatting domain names, and quantify the harm caused by various typosquatting perpetrators. We find that typosquatting costs the typical user 1.3 seconds per typosquatting event over the alternative of receiving a browser error page, and legitimate sites lose approximately 5% of their mistyped traffic over the alternative of an unregistered typo. Although on average perpetrators increase the time it takes a user to find their intended site, many typosquatters actually improve the latency between a typo and its correction, calling into question the necessity of harsh penalties or legal intervention against this flavor of cybercrime. This is a joint work with Mohammad Taha Khan, Xiang Huo and Prof. Chris Kanich University of Illinois at Chicago.

From Mental Poker to Core Business: Why and How to Deploy Secure Computation Protocols?,Prof. Moti Yung(Google Inc. and Columbia University),2015-11-05,中国科学院信息工程研究所3号楼3224会议室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201511/t20151104_314265.html,none,"Technological innovations in security and privacy are critical to advancing modern computing in our time. I will present an effort involving deployment of experimental commercial applications designed and built as a secure multi-party computation protocol for specific tasks, to be used repetitively to achieve a number of concrete ubiquitous business goals. In these applications, the outputs are calculated in the presence of privacy constraints which prevent parties from sharing their individual inputs directly and openly. I will also discuss what I think are the reasons for the inherent difficulty of developing such routines in general (for achieving business goals). In particular, I will survey what I believe to be the reasons that almost 40 years since secure computation protocols was invented as a basic theoretical notion, capturing specific and then general computational tasks, and in spite of its theoretical and even experimentation success, the notion has not yet been widely and seriously used in achieving routine relevant business goals (in contrast with symmetric key and public key cryptosystems and protocols, which were also proposed 40 years ago and are used extensively, primarily to implement secure authenticated channels). The presentation will also cover the general bottom up methodology used in this effort leading to the design and development process. This exemplifying methodology includes: feasibility study of the specific domain, extraction of business needs which are limited by privacy constraints, application analysis from the perspective of utility metrics and secure computing. Then, the methodology further includes design, implementation, and experimentation, guided by the analysis and employing appropriate protocols, while considering scale and performance constraints, and cost overhead that is tolerable.",none

These views may be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. For example, a person can be identified by face, fingerprint, signature or iris with information obtained from multiple sources, while an image can be represented by its color or texture features, which can be seen as different feature subsets of the image. In this talk, we will organize the similarities and differences between a wide variety of multi-view learning approaches, highlight their limitations, and then demonstrate the basic fundamentals for the success of multi-view learning. The thorough investigation on the view insufficiency problem and the in-depth analysis on the influence of view properties (consistence and complementarity) will be beneficial for the continuous development of multi-view learning.","Dacheng Tao (F’15) is Professor of Computer Science with the Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, and the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology in the University of Technology, Sydney.

Clipping the Power of Kleptographic Attacks,Qiang Tang PH.D.,2015-08-25,地中国科学院信息工程研究所3号楼（B2座）3224室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201508/t20150813_301994.html,none,"Kleptography, originally introduced by Young and Yung [Crypto ’96], studies how to steal information securely and subliminally from cryptosystems. The basic framework considers the (in)security of malicious implementations of a standard cryptographic primitive by embedding a“backdoor” into the system. Remarkably, crippling subliminal theft is possible even if the subvertedcryptosystem produces output indistinguishable from a secure “reference implementation.” After a long hiatus, interest in such issues was rekindled by the dramatic revelations of Edward Snowden, demonstrating that such deliberate attacks have been deployed and presumably used for massive surveillance. Notably, Bellare, Paterson, and Rogaway [Crypto ’14] initiated a formal study of attacks on symmetric key encryption algorithms.Motivated by the original examples of subverting key generation algorithms in the kleptography papers from Young and Yung [Crypto ’96, Eurocrypt ’97], we initiate the study of cryptography in the setting where ALL algorithms are subject to kleptographic attacks—we call this cliptography.  In this talk, I will present some of our recent progress along this line.","Qiang Tang graduated from SKLOIS in 2009, and recently got his Ph.D from the University of Connecticut, under the supervision of Aggelos Kiayias and Alexander Russell.

Towards Obfuscation-Resilient Software Plagiarism Detection,Dinghao Wu教授,2015-07-30,中国科学院信息工程研究所3号楼3224室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201507/t20150727_300733.html,none,"Software plagiarism, an act of illegally copying others’ code, has become a serious concern for honest software companies and the open source community. In this talk, I will present two program logic and semantics based methods that are obfuscation resilient. The first method is based on program behavior deviation detection. By detecting deviations between two programs, we rule out non-plagiarism; otherwise, by a repeated probabilistic argument, we conclude it is a plagiarism case. The second method uses a novel concept called longest common subsequences (LCS) of semantically equivalent basic blocks. We first compute the semantic equivalence of basic blocks, and then detect the LCS of two paths from two programs under consideration with the same input, with binary basic blocks as the sequence elements.  A similarity score is calculated based on the relative LCS length, which indicates the behavior similarity of the two programs under consideration.  The results of these two methods are published in ISSRE’14 and FSE’14.","Dinghao Wu is an Assistant Professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at The Pennsylvania State University.

However there are several significant challenges in securing cloud infrastructures from different types of attacks. The focus of this paper is on the security services that a cloud provider can offer as part of its infrastructure to its customers (tenants) to counteract these attacks. The main idea in this talk is a “security as a service” model that a cloud provider can offer to its tenants and customers of its tenants. Our security as a service model while offering a baseline security to the provider to protect its own cloud infrastructure also provides flexibility to tenants to have additional security functionalities that suit their security requirements.

We design a new heuristic algorithm with an improved bit complexity O(q^(3.4)) (or algebraic complexity O(q^(2.4)) ) to compute the discrete logarithms of elements in a factor base of cardinality q^2. We reduce the correctness of the algorithm to a conjecture concerning the determinant of a simple (q+1)-dimensional lattice, rather than to elusive smoothness assumptions. We verify the conjecture numerically for all qs such that 〖log〗_2 q^(2(q-1))≤5000, and provide theoretical supporting evidences.

The sum can be weaker than each part,王磊,2015-05-28,3224会议室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201505/t20150528_293005.html,none,"In this paper we study the security of summing the outputs of two independent hash functions, in an effort to increase the security of the resulting design, or to hedge against the failure of one of the hash functions. The exclusive-or (XOR) combiner $H_1(M) \oplus H_2(M)$ is one of the two most classical combiners, together with the concatenation combiner $H_1(M) \| H_2(M)$. While the security of the concatenation of two hash functions is well understood since Jouxs seminal work on multicollisions, the security of the sum of two hash functions has been much less studied.The XOR combiner is well known as a good PRF and MAC combiner, and is used in practice in TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. In a hash function setting, Hoch and Shamir have shown that if the compression functions are modeled as random oracles, or even weak random oracles  i.e. they can easily be inverted -- in particular $H_1$ and $H_2$ offer no security), $H_1 + H_2$ is indifferentiable from a random oracle up to the birthday bound.In this work, we focus on the preimage resistance of the sum of two narrow-pipe $n$-bit hash functions, following the Merkle-Damg{a}rd or HAIFA structure (the internal state size and the output size are both $n$ bits). We show a rather surprising result: the sum of two such hash functions, e.g. SHA-512 + Whirlpool, can never provide $n$-bit security for preimage resistance. More precisely, we present a generic preimage attack with a complexity of $	ilde O(2^{5n/6})$. While it is already known that the XOR combiner is not preserving for preimage resistance (i.e. there might be some instantiations where the hash functions are secure but the sum is not), our result is much stronger: for any narrow-pipe functions, the sum is not preimage resistant.Besides, we also provide concrete preimage attacks on the XOR combiner (and the concatenation combiner) when one or both of the compression functions are weak; this complements Hoch and Shamirs proof by showing its tightness for preimage resistance.Of independent interests, one of our main technical contributions is a novel structure to control simultaneously the behavior of independent hash computations which share the same input message.  We hope that breaking the pairwise relationship between their internal states will have applications in related settings.",none

By contrast, finding correspondence among an ensemble of objects remains challenging. In this talk we will present a new unified framework for this problem and its application to computer vision and medical image. Specifically, we have established a close correlation between the classical multi-dimensional assignment (MDA) problem and low-rank tensor approximation. Such correlation paves a way of using high-order tensor analysis for groupwise visual matching that assumes an MDA formulation. Along the way, we developed a series of power-iteration algorithms and applied them to multiple target tracking (in the context of video surveillance) and deformable tracking (in the context of medical image analysis).

Learning a Zonotope and More: Cryptanalysis of NTRUSign Countermeasures,"Prof. Phong Nguyen (INRIA, France and Tsinghua University, China)",2012-05-14,中国科学院信息工程研究所3号楼3221室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201406/t20140619_240666.html,none,"There is growing interest in lattice cryptography, but from a practical point of view, only one lattice signature scheme is competitive with standard signatures: NTRUSIGN, designed in 2003. The basic version of NTRUSIGN was broken by Nguyen and Regev in 2006: one can efficiently recover the secret key from about 400 signatures. However, countermeasures have been proposed to repair the scheme, such as the perturbation used in NTRUSIGN standardization proposals, and the deformation proposed by Hu et al. at IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory in 2008. These two countermeasures were claimed to prevent the NR attack. Surprisingly, we show that these two claims are incorrect by revisiting the NR gradient-descent attack: the attack is much more powerful than previously expected, and breaks both countermeasures in practice, after suitable optimization. More precisely, the Nguyen-Regev algorithm for learning a parallelepiped is heuristically able to learn more complex objects, such as zonotopes and deformed parallelepipeds. As a concrete application, we recover the NTRUSIGN secret key in a few hours, using 8,000 signatures for the original NTRUSIGN-251 scheme with one perturbation submitted to IEEE P1363 in 2003, or 6,000 signatures for the latest 80-bit- security parameter set proposed in 2010.","Phong Nguyen obtained his PhD in 1999, and has been a research director at INRIA since 2008, and a guest professor at Tsinghua University since Fall 2011.

Towards Wireless Building Management Systems: A Design Requiring No Change to the Upper-Layer Building Protocols,王丹博士，香港理工大学,2012-06-18,中国科学院信息工程研究所3号楼（B2座）3222室 ,信息安全国家重点实验室,http://sklois.iie.cas.cn/tzgg/tzgg_16520/201406/t20140619_240661.html,none,"There are many recent efforts in developing wireless or partially wireless Building Management Systems (BMS). A key difference from developing a brand new wireless sensor application, where one can design the system from scratch, is that there exist wired building management systems and there is a full set of upper layer protocols developed and standardized. Ongoing studies on wireless BMS usually develop smart sensor hardware and re-design protocols from bottom up. Such approach requires a long time for standardization and adoption.In this talk, we study from a new direction by proposing a general framework that converts existing wired sensor network into wireless without change of upper layer protocols and the existing hardware. The key ideas are an asynchronous-response framework to maintain the control plane of the upper layer protocol intact, and a modular design to prioritize and schedule data flows in case of link quality and throughput variation. Our design can become a supplement for existing studies towards developing wireless building management systems. We evaluate our system using both comprehensive simulations and experiments with real BMS hardware, software and protocols running on top. We made a field deployment by integrating our system into the BMS of the FG building of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The system operated smoothly during our five-hour deployment.","Dan Wang received the B.Sc degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2000, the M.Sc degree from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, in 2004, and the Ph.
