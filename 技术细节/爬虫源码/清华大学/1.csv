Differentiating Imaging Systems for Boosting 3D Perception,Wenzheng Chen University of Toronto,2023-05-09 16:00-2023-05-09 17:00,C19-2 or 腾讯会议：https://meeting.tencent.com/dm/pf1RylREXVgw,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10390-1.html,2023-05-09 16:00-2023-05-09 17:00,"The ability to infer 3D properties, such as geometry, texture, material, and light from 2D photographs is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and plays a key in many domains such as AR/VR, robotics, autonomous driving, and Metaverse. To tackle this problem, various imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms are proposed. As a two-stage procedure, 3D perception consists of “imaging” and “reconstruction”, wherein the former involves the use of devices to measure the scene and acquire the measurement, such as photographs, while the latter applies reconstruction algorithms on the measurement to recover 3D properties. While previous methods focus more on reconstruction algorithms and ignore the knowledge in the imaging stage, in this talk, we show how to develop a holistic method to connect ‘‘imaging‘’ and ‘’reconstruction‘’ together, utilizing the information from both sides. Specifically, we propose to model various imaging systems in a differentiable way and connect them with the reconstruction algorithms, such that the information (e.g., gradients) can be freely propagated bidirectionally. Such a connection boosts 3D perception in 2 directions: “learning for imaging‘’ and “imaging for learning“. The former passes the information of imaging systems to the reconstruction algorithms, which helps design the algorithms that perfectly match the chosen imaging systems. The latter propagates the information from reconstruction algorithms to imaging systems, helping explore the best settings they should adopt under specific algorithms. We demonstrate that the proposed method brings huge improvement and successfully pushes the boundary of 3D perception.","Wenzheng Chen is a final-year Ph.D. student at University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Sanja Fidler and Prof. Kyros Kutulakos.

A universal theory of spin squeezing and the experimental realization,Bingtian Ye Harvard University,2023-04-28 15:00-2023-04-28 16:00,FIT 1-315,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10384-1.html,2023-04-28 15:00-2023-04-28 16:00,"Quantum metrology makes use of many-body entangled states to perform measurements with greater precision than would be possible using only classically correlated particles. Discerning states suitable for quantum metrology is a delicate task: nearly all states in Hilbert space are highly entangled, but nearly none of them exhibit the structured entanglement required for enhanced sensing. Identifying universal principles for finding metrologically-useful states remains a long-standing challenge, especially in the context of efficiently preparing such states from unentangled product states. One such principle stems from the observation that the metrological gain from a pure state is fundamentally connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this work, we apply this principle to the case of U(1) symmetry breaking and provide extensive numerical and analytical evidence for the following conjecture: Finite-temperature easy-plane ferromagnetism (i.e. XY magnets) enables scalable spin squeezing. In particular, we consider the quench dynamics of a low-energy initial state and show it undergoes squeezing as a precursor to the equilibration of long-range order. In particular, we establish a phase diagram for spin-squeezing, and demonstrate that the phase transition precisely coincides with the phase boundary for finite-temperature XY order. Moreover, we show that the squeezing manifests a novel scaling with system size that leads to a sensitivity ∼ N- 10 7 , in between the standard quantum limit ∼ N- 1 2 and the Heisenberg limit ∼ N-1. Finally, I will present two experimental pursuits to realize scalable spin squeezing. In a 87Rb atom tweezer array, we observe scalable spin squeezing with the presence of dipolar XY interaction. Recently developed technique to implant nitrogenvacancy defects in a 2D layer may also enable scalable squeezing in solid state systems, which paves a more practical way to implement spin squeezing in real-life quantum sensing.","Bingtian is a physics PhD candidate at Harvard University, advised by Prof. Norman Y.

Exploring the critical physics with a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array in optical tweezers,Yu Wang Harvard University,2023-04-27 15:30-2023-04-27 16:30,FIT 1-222,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10383-1.html,2023-04-27 15:30-2023-04-27 16:30,"Recently, Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer has been a central topic of intense research interest with application ranging from quantum metrology, quantum simulation and quantum computation. Based on the technique of adiabatic preparation of the manybody ground state with the reconfigurable Rydberg array, we could probe the critical physics predicted by conformal field theory. In this talk, I will describe how we build up the system and adiabatically prepare the ground state. With the existence of various practical imperfections, we performed numerical and experimental investigation of possible error sources and achieved quantitative agreements with the CFT results of the scaling components. With some technical upgrade, it could provide predictions in higher dimensions.

Reconstructing the Tree of Life (Fitting Distances by Tree Metrics),Mikkel Thorup University of Copenhagen,2023-04-27 14:00-2023-04-27 15:00,FIT 1-222,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10376-1.html,2023-04-27 14:00-2023-04-27 15:00,"We consider the numerical taxonomy problem of fitting an SxS distance matrix D with a tree metric T. For some k, we want to minimize the L_k norm of the errors, that is,
Pick T so as to minimize (sum_{i,j in S} |D(i,j)-T(i,j)|^k)^{1/k}
This problem was raised in biology in the 1960s for k=1,2. The biological interpretation is that T represents a possible evolution behind the species in S matching some measured distances in D. Sometimes, it is required that T is an ultrametric, meaning that all species are at the same distance from the root.
An Evolutionary tree induces a hierarchical classification of species and this is not just tied to biology. Medicine, ecology and linguistics are just some of the fields where this concept appears, and it is even an integral part of machine learning and data science. Fundamentally, if we can approximate distances with a tree, then they are much easier to reason about: many questions that are NP-hard for general metrics can be answered in linear time on tree metrics. In fact, humans have appreciated hierarchical classifications at least since Plato and Aristotle (350 BC).
We will review the basic results on the problem, including the most recent result from FOCS'21 https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02807. They paint a varied landscape with big differences between different moments, and with some very nice open problems remaining.
At STOC'93, Farach, Kannan, and Warnow proved that under L_infty, we can find the optimal ultrametric. Almost all other variants of the problem are APX-hard.
At SODA'96, Agarwala, Bafna, Farach, Paterson, and Thorup showed that for any norm L_k, k>=1, if the best ultrametric can be A-approximated, then the best tree metric can be 3A-approximated. In particular, this implied a 3-approximation for tree metrics under L_infty.
At FOCS'05, Ailon and Charikar showed that for any L_k, k>=1, we can get an O(((log n)(loglog n))^{1/k}) approximation for both tree and ultrametrics. Their paper was focused on the L_1 norm, and they wrote ``Determining whether an O(1) approximation can be obtained is a fascinating question"".
At FOCS'21, Cohen-Addad, Das, Kipouridis, Parotsidis, and Thorup showed that indeed a constant factor is possible for L_1 for both tree and ultrametrics. This uses the special structure of L_1 in relation to hierarchies.
The status of L_k is open for 1

This talk will present several protocols for atoms to perform quantum computing and solve difficult problems. I will describe a local quantum annealing architecture, by which atoms can be used for solving binary optimization. This has wide applications in factorization, combinatorial optimization, and graph partitioning.

Long Distance Quantum Key Distribution,Lai Zhou Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences,2023-04-21 14:00-2023-04-21 15:00,MMW-S327,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10374-1.html,2023-04-21 14:00-2023-04-21 15:00,"Quantum cryptography promises secure communication between two distant users. However, secure key rate of point-point quantum key distribution (QKD) is bounded by the linear rate-loss limit. Twin-field (TF) QKD can break this limit but its implementation requires global phase tracking and usually also cumbersome interferometric implementations, which are often impractical for network deployment. We remove the above shortcomings with two different solutions. In the first solution, we introduce locally generated frequency combs to stabilise an open channel, and develop a simple and versatile TF-QKD setup that does not need service fibre [1]. In the second, we implement a simple measurement device independent (MDI) QKD with post-measurement pairing technique. We demonstrate the capability of asynchronous MDI-QKD (also named mode-pairing MDI-QKD) overcoming the linear rate-loss limit without global phase tracking [2].

How can we infer, represent, and use such structure from raw data, without hampering the expressiveness of neural networks? In this talk, I will demonstrate that such structure, or code, can be learned from natural supervision. Here, natural supervision can be from pixels, where neuro-symbolic methods automatically discover repetitive parts and objects for scene synthesis. It can also be from objects, where humans during fabrication introduce priors that can be leveraged by machines to infer regular intrinsics such as texture and material. When solving these problems, structured representations and neural nets play complementary roles: it is more data-efficient to learn with structured representations, and they generalize better to new scenarios with robustly captured high-level information; neural nets effectively extract complex, low-level features from cluttered and noisy visual data.","Jiajun Wu is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, working on computer vision, machine learning, and computational cognitive science.

Fast and Accurate PDE Solvers via Neural Fields,Yichen Chen MIT CSAIL,2023-04-17 16:00-2023-04-17 17:00,C19-2 or 腾讯会议：203-746-249,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10366-1.html,2023-04-17 16:00-2023-04-17 17:00,"Numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often entails spatial discretizations. Traditional methods (e.g., finite difference, finite element, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) adopt spatial discretizations, such as grids, meshes, and point clouds. While intuitive to model and understand, these discretizations suffer from (1) long runtime for large-scale problems with many spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs); (2) discretization errors, such as dissipation (fluid) and inaccurate contact (solid). In this talk, we will discuss our two recent works leveraging implicit neural representations (also known as neural fields) to tackle traditional representations’ excessive runtime and discretization errors.
The first work accelerates PDE solvers using reduced-order modeling (ROM). Whereas prior ROM approaches reduce the dimensionality of discretized vector fields, our continuous reduced-order modeling (CROM) approach builds a low-dimensional manifold of the continuous vector fields themselves, not their discretization. Compared to prior discretization-dependent ROM methods (e.g., POD, PCA, autoencoders), CROM features higher accuracy (49-79x), lower memory consumption (39-132x), dynamically adaptive resolutions, and applicability to any discretization. Experiments demonstrate 109x and 89x wall-clock speedups over unreduced models on CPUs and GPUs.
The second work encodes spatial information through neural network weights and computes PDE time-stepping with optimization time integrators. While slower to compute than traditional representations, our approach achieves higher accuracy under the same memory constraint and features adaptive allocation of DOFs without complex remeshing.","Peter Yichen Chen is a postdoctoral associate at MIT CSAIL, advised by Wojciech Matusik.

Enhancing the Creative Process in Digital Prototyping,Zeyu Wang Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,2023-04-13 19:00-2023-04-13 20:00,C19-2 or 腾讯会议：398-077-2882,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10365-1.html,2023-04-13 19:00-2023-04-13 20:00,"Despite advances in computer-aided design (CAD) systems and video editing software, digital content creation for design, storytelling, and interactive experiences remains a challenging problem. This talk introduces a series of studies, techniques, and systems along three thrusts that engage creators more directly and enhance the user experience in authoring digital content.
First, we present a drawing dataset and spatiotemporal analysis that provide insight into how people draw by comparing tracing, freehand drawing, and computer-generated approximations. We found a high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used over time, which informs methods for customized stroke treatment and emulating drawing processes. We also propose a deep learning-based technique for line drawing synthesis from animated 3D models, where our learned style space and optimization-based embedding enable the generation of line drawing animations while allowing interactive user control across frames.
Second, we demonstrate the importance of utilizing spatial context in the creative process in augmented reality (AR) through two tablet-based interfaces. DistanciAR enables designers to create site-specific AR experiences for remote environments using LiDAR capture and new authoring modes, such as Dollhouse and Peek. PointShopAR integrates point cloud capture and editing in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in their spatial context. Our user studies show that LiDAR capture and the point cloud representation in these systems can make rapid AR prototyping more accessible and versatile.
Last, we introduce two procedural methods to generate time-based media for visual communication and storytelling. AniCode supports authoring and on-the-fly consumption of personalized animations in a network-free environment via a printed code. CHER-Ob generates video flythroughs for storytelling from annotated heterogeneous 2D and 3D data for cultural heritage.

This talk discusses two basic aspects for incorporating language models with the automacy of interacting with external environments, to learn beyond static corpora and accomplish goals beyond text generation. (1) Building environments to develop language agents. We present the WebShop benchmark, and show interaction with the Internet is more scalable than existing paradigms like games and dialog systems, and enables transfer to real-world tasks, e.g. shopping on amazon.com. (2) Adapting language models for interactive learning. We present ReAct, an idea to synergize reasoning and acting for language models, which achieve state-of-the-art few-shot results on multiple reasoning and sequential decision making problems, with reduced hallucinations and increased human alignment. We also present CALM, an idea to integrate language models with reinforcement learning agents to flexibly adapt to downstream tasks, while preserving pre-trained priors and avoiding language drift.","Shunyu Yao is a 4th year Phd student with Karthik Narasimhan at Princeton NLP Group, working at the intersection of language and reinforcement learning.

"Sequential generalized measurements: Aysmptotics, typicality and emergent projective measurements",WenLong Ma Institute of Semiconductors Chinese Academy of Sciences,2023-04-07 14:00-2023-04-07 15:00,MMW-S327,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10363-1.html,2023-04-07 14:00-2023-04-07 15:00,"The relation between projective measurements and generalized quantum measurements is a fundamental problem in quantum physics, and clarifying this issue is also important to quantum technologies. While it has been intuitively known that projective measurements can be constructed from sequential generalized or weak measurements [1, 2], there is still lack of a proof of this hypothesis in general cases. Here we prove it from the perspective of quantum channels [3]. We show that projective measurements naturally arise from sequential generalized measurements in the asymptotic limit. Specifically, a selective projective measurement arises from a set of typical sequences of sequential generalized measurements. We provide an explicit scheme to construct projective measurements of a quantum system with sequential generalized quantum measurements. Remarkably, a single ancilla qubit is sufficient to mediate sequential generalized measurements for constructing arbitrary projective measurements of a generic system, which can have applications in readout, initialization, and feedback control of a quantum system. As an example, we present a protocol to measure the modular excitation numbers of a bosonic mode with an ancilla qubit, which are exactly the error syndromes of rotation-symmetric bosonic quantum error correction codes.

To tackle this problem, various imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms are proposed. As a two-stage procedure, 3D perception consists of “imaging” and “reconstruction”, wherein the former involves the use of devices to measure the scene and acquire the measurement, such as photographs, while the latter applies reconstruction algorithms on the measurement to recover 3D properties. While previous methods focus more on reconstruction algorithms and ignore the knowledge in the imaging stage, in this talk, we show how to develop a holistic method to connect ‘‘imaging‘’ and ‘’reconstruction‘’ together, utilizing the information from both sides. Specifically, we propose to model various imaging systems in a differentiable way and connect them with the reconstruction algorithms, such that the information (e.g., gradients) can be freely propagated bidirectionally. Such a connection boosts 3D perception in 2 directions: “learning for imaging‘’ and “imaging for learning“. The former passes the information of imaging systems to the reconstruction algorithms, which helps design the algorithms that perfectly match the chosen imaging systems. The latter propagates the information from reconstruction algorithms to imaging systems, helping explore the best settings they should adopt under specific algorithms. We demonstrate that the proposed method brings huge improvement and successfully pushes the boundary of 3D perception.","Wenzheng Chen is a final-year Ph.D. student at University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Sanja Fidler and Prof. Kyros Kutulakos.

A universal theory of spin squeezing and the experimental realization,Bingtian Ye Harvard University,2023-04-28 15:00-2023-04-28 16:00,FIT 1-315,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10384-1.html,2023-04-28 15:00-2023-04-28 16:00,"Quantum metrology makes use of many-body entangled states to perform measurements with greater precision than would be possible using only classically correlated particles. Discerning states suitable for quantum metrology is a delicate task: nearly all states in Hilbert space are highly entangled, but nearly none of them exhibit the structured entanglement required for enhanced sensing. Identifying universal principles for finding metrologically-useful states remains a long-standing challenge, especially in the context of efficiently preparing such states from unentangled product states. One such principle stems from the observation that the metrological gain from a pure state is fundamentally connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this work, we apply this principle to the case of U(1) symmetry breaking and provide extensive numerical and analytical evidence for the following conjecture: Finite-temperature easy-plane ferromagnetism (i.e. XY magnets) enables scalable spin squeezing. In particular, we consider the quench dynamics of a low-energy initial state and show it undergoes squeezing as a precursor to the equilibration of long-range order. In particular, we establish a phase diagram for spin-squeezing, and demonstrate that the phase transition precisely coincides with the phase boundary for finite-temperature XY order. Moreover, we show that the squeezing manifests a novel scaling with system size that leads to a sensitivity ∼ N- 10 7 , in between the standard quantum limit ∼ N- 1 2 and the Heisenberg limit ∼ N-1. Finally, I will present two experimental pursuits to realize scalable spin squeezing. In a 87Rb atom tweezer array, we observe scalable spin squeezing with the presence of dipolar XY interaction. Recently developed technique to implant nitrogenvacancy defects in a 2D layer may also enable scalable squeezing in solid state systems, which paves a more practical way to implement spin squeezing in real-life quantum sensing.","Bingtian is a physics PhD candidate at Harvard University, advised by Prof. Norman Y.

Reconstructing the Tree of Life (Fitting Distances by Tree Metrics),Mikkel Thorup University of Copenhagen,2023-04-27 14:00-2023-04-27 15:00,FIT 1-222,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10376-1.html,2023-04-27 14:00-2023-04-27 15:00,"We consider the numerical taxonomy problem of fitting an SxS distance matrix D with a tree metric T. For some k, we want to minimize the L_k norm of the errors, that is,
Pick T so as to minimize (sum_{i,j in S} |D(i,j)-T(i,j)|^k)^{1/k}
This problem was raised in biology in the 1960s for k=1,2. The biological interpretation is that T represents a possible evolution behind the species in S matching some measured distances in D. Sometimes, it is required that T is an ultrametric, meaning that all species are at the same distance from the root.
An Evolutionary tree induces a hierarchical classification of species and this is not just tied to biology. Medicine, ecology and linguistics are just some of the fields where this concept appears, and it is even an integral part of machine learning and data science. Fundamentally, if we can approximate distances with a tree, then they are much easier to reason about: many questions that are NP-hard for general metrics can be answered in linear time on tree metrics. In fact, humans have appreciated hierarchical classifications at least since Plato and Aristotle (350 BC).
We will review the basic results on the problem, including the most recent result from FOCS'21 https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02807. They paint a varied landscape with big differences between different moments, and with some very nice open problems remaining.
At STOC'93, Farach, Kannan, and Warnow proved that under L_infty, we can find the optimal ultrametric. Almost all other variants of the problem are APX-hard.
At SODA'96, Agarwala, Bafna, Farach, Paterson, and Thorup showed that for any norm L_k, k>=1, if the best ultrametric can be A-approximated, then the best tree metric can be 3A-approximated. In particular, this implied a 3-approximation for tree metrics under L_infty.
At FOCS'05, Ailon and Charikar showed that for any L_k, k>=1, we can get an O(((log n)(loglog n))^{1/k}) approximation for both tree and ultrametrics. Their paper was focused on the L_1 norm, and they wrote ``Determining whether an O(1) approximation can be obtained is a fascinating question"".
At FOCS'21, Cohen-Addad, Das, Kipouridis, Parotsidis, and Thorup showed that indeed a constant factor is possible for L_1 for both tree and ultrametrics. This uses the special structure of L_1 in relation to hierarchies.
The status of L_k is open for 1

However, secure key rate of point-point quantum key distribution (QKD) is bounded by the linear rate-loss limit. Twin-field (TF) QKD can break this limit but its implementation requires global phase tracking and usually also cumbersome interferometric implementations, which are often impractical for network deployment. We remove the above shortcomings with two different solutions. In the first solution, we introduce locally generated frequency combs to stabilise an open channel, and develop a simple and versatile TF-QKD setup that does not need service fibre [1]. In the second, we implement a simple measurement device independent (MDI) QKD with post-measurement pairing technique. We demonstrate the capability of asynchronous MDI-QKD (also named mode-pairing MDI-QKD) overcoming the linear rate-loss limit without global phase tracking [2].

In this talk, I will demonstrate that such structure, or code, can be learned from natural supervision. Here, natural supervision can be from pixels, where neuro-symbolic methods automatically discover repetitive parts and objects for scene synthesis. It can also be from objects, where humans during fabrication introduce priors that can be leveraged by machines to infer regular intrinsics such as texture and material. When solving these problems, structured representations and neural nets play complementary roles: it is more data-efficient to learn with structured representations, and they generalize better to new scenarios with robustly captured high-level information; neural nets effectively extract complex, low-level features from cluttered and noisy visual data.","Jiajun Wu is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, working on computer vision, machine learning, and computational cognitive science.

However, comparatively, dexterous manipulation research has received much less attention due to its complexities in control, sensing, hardware design, etc. In this talk, I will share our initial effort in developing a learning pipeline that efficiently learns generalizable contact-rich skills from raw sensory data using a low-cost hardware system costing less than $5000. Our system has achieved zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on dynamic and contact-rich tasks (in-hand object reorientation), and is capable of reorienting hundreds of geometrically distinct objects.","Tao Chen is a Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL, advised by Prof. Pulkit Agrawal.

Machine learning is existentially enabling this quest. In this talk, I will discuss how looking from the perspective of combining differentiable iso-surfacing with differentiable rendering could enable 3D content creation at scale and make a real-world impact. Towards this end, we first introduce a differentiable 3D representation based on a tetrahedral grid to enable high-quality recovery of 3D mesh with arbitrary topology. By incorporating differentiable rendering, we further design a generative model capable of producing 3D shapes with complex textures and materials for mesh generation.

Fast and Accurate PDE Solvers via Neural Fields,Yichen Chen MIT CSAIL,2023-04-17 16:00-2023-04-17 17:00,C19-2 or 腾讯会议：203-746-249,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10366-1.html,2023-04-17 16:00-2023-04-17 17:00,"Numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often entails spatial discretizations. Traditional methods (e.g., finite difference, finite element, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) adopt spatial discretizations, such as grids, meshes, and point clouds. While intuitive to model and understand, these discretizations suffer from (1) long runtime for large-scale problems with many spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs); (2) discretization errors, such as dissipation (fluid) and inaccurate contact (solid). In this talk, we will discuss our two recent works leveraging implicit neural representations (also known as neural fields) to tackle traditional representations’ excessive runtime and discretization errors.
The first work accelerates PDE solvers using reduced-order modeling (ROM). Whereas prior ROM approaches reduce the dimensionality of discretized vector fields, our continuous reduced-order modeling (CROM) approach builds a low-dimensional manifold of the continuous vector fields themselves, not their discretization. Compared to prior discretization-dependent ROM methods (e.g., POD, PCA, autoencoders), CROM features higher accuracy (49-79x), lower memory consumption (39-132x), dynamically adaptive resolutions, and applicability to any discretization. Experiments demonstrate 109x and 89x wall-clock speedups over unreduced models on CPUs and GPUs.
The second work encodes spatial information through neural network weights and computes PDE time-stepping with optimization time integrators. While slower to compute than traditional representations, our approach achieves higher accuracy under the same memory constraint and features adaptive allocation of DOFs without complex remeshing.","Peter Yichen Chen is a postdoctoral associate at MIT CSAIL, advised by Wojciech Matusik.

This talk introduces a series of studies, techniques, and systems along three thrusts that engage creators more directly and enhance the user experience in authoring digital content.
First, we present a drawing dataset and spatiotemporal analysis that provide insight into how people draw by comparing tracing, freehand drawing, and computer-generated approximations. We found a high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used over time, which informs methods for customized stroke treatment and emulating drawing processes. We also propose a deep learning-based technique for line drawing synthesis from animated 3D models, where our learned style space and optimization-based embedding enable the generation of line drawing animations while allowing interactive user control across frames.
Second, we demonstrate the importance of utilizing spatial context in the creative process in augmented reality (AR) through two tablet-based interfaces. DistanciAR enables designers to create site-specific AR experiences for remote environments using LiDAR capture and new authoring modes, such as Dollhouse and Peek. PointShopAR integrates point cloud capture and editing in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in their spatial context. Our user studies show that LiDAR capture and the point cloud representation in these systems can make rapid AR prototyping more accessible and versatile.
Last, we introduce two procedural methods to generate time-based media for visual communication and storytelling. AniCode supports authoring and on-the-fly consumption of personalized animations in a network-free environment via a printed code. CHER-Ob generates video flythroughs for storytelling from annotated heterogeneous 2D and 3D data for cultural heritage. Our user studies show that these methods can benefit the video-oriented digital prototyping experience and facilitate the dissemination of creative and cultural ideas.","Zeyu Wang is an Assistant Professor of Computational Media and Arts (CMA) in the Information Hub at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) and an Affiliate Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

"Sequential generalized measurements: Aysmptotics, typicality and emergent projective measurements",WenLong Ma Institute of Semiconductors Chinese Academy of Sciences,2023-04-07 14:00-2023-04-07 15:00,MMW-S327,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10363-1.html,2023-04-07 14:00-2023-04-07 15:00,"The relation between projective measurements and generalized quantum measurements is a fundamental problem in quantum physics, and clarifying this issue is also important to quantum technologies. While it has been intuitively known that projective measurements can be constructed from sequential generalized or weak measurements [1, 2], there is still lack of a proof of this hypothesis in general cases. Here we prove it from the perspective of quantum channels [3]. We show that projective measurements naturally arise from sequential generalized measurements in the asymptotic limit. Specifically, a selective projective measurement arises from a set of typical sequences of sequential generalized measurements. We provide an explicit scheme to construct projective measurements of a quantum system with sequential generalized quantum measurements. Remarkably, a single ancilla qubit is sufficient to mediate sequential generalized measurements for constructing arbitrary projective measurements of a generic system, which can have applications in readout, initialization, and feedback control of a quantum system. As an example, we present a protocol to measure the modular excitation numbers of a bosonic mode with an ancilla qubit, which are exactly the error syndromes of rotation-symmetric bosonic quantum error correction codes.

Reducing the Ever-growing Cost of Large-Scale Machine Learning Services,Binhang Yuan,2023-03-01 18:00-2023-03-01 19:30,FIT Building，Room 1-222 + Zoom Meeting: 895 3056 1898 （passcode：962687）,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-10350-1.html,2023-03-01 18:00-2023-03-01 19:30,"The recent success of machine learning (ML) has dramatically benefited from the exponential growth of ML model capacity. However, the enormous capacity of ML models also leads to a significantly higher cost. In practice, the high cost of ML comes from three sources: i) the cost of optimizing/deploying ML services over the ever-changing hardware; ii) the low utilization of the hardware due to parallel/distributed communication overhead; and iii) the high cost of accessing the hardware. 
 
My work attempts to reduce the cost in all three categories above: Developing and deploying ML workflows in ever-changing execution environments is a tedious and time-consuming job and would require a significant amount of engineering effort to scale out the computation; my work proposes new abstractions for ML system design and implementation with expressivity, easy optimization, and high performance. In parallel/distributed ML training, communication is usually the main bottleneck that restricts hardware efficiency; my work explores system relaxations of communications under different parallel ML training paradigms to increase hardware efficiency without compromising their statistical efficiency. Given the advances in system optimization and relaxation, my work further investigates how to deploy the ML service over a decentralized open collective environment consisting of much cheaper and underutilized decentralized GPUs; the result is promising: when the decentralized interconnections are 100X slower than the data center network, under efficient scheduling, the end-to-end training throughput is only 1.7~3.5X slower than the state-of-the-art solutions inside a data center.",Binhang Yuan is a postdoc research scientist in the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Dr. Ce Zhang.

How many queries are needed to obtain a 1+ϵ relative error approximation of the optimum? While this problem has been extensively studied for least squares regression, little is known for other losses. An important example is least absolute deviation regression (ℓ1 regression) which enjoys superior robustness to outliers compared to least squares. We develop a new framework for analyzing importance sampling methods in regression problems, which enables us to show that the query complexity of least absolute deviation regression is Θ(d/ϵ^2) up to logarithmic factors. We further extend our techniques to show the first bounds on the query complexity for any ℓp loss with p∈(1,2).
 
As a key novelty in our analysis, we introduce the notion of robust uniform convergence, which is a new approximation guarantee for the empirical loss. While it is inspired by uniform convergence in statistical learning, our approach additionally incorporates a correction term to avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers. This can be viewed as a new connection between statistical learning theory and variance reduction techniques in stochastic optimization, which should be of independent interest.

Such properties should be naturally related to the concept of topological order in mixed states.

In the concrete example of the 2D Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code. Time permitted, I will also discuss a so-called error-field double formalism, that provides a more general perspective by mapping the error-induced phases to boundary anyon condensation.","Before starting his PhD, Ruihua Fan did his undergrad research at Prof. Hui Zhai's group at IASTU.

Since physical systems are unavoidably coupled to the environment, quantum noise, which can qualitatively modify or even destroy certain entanglement structures, needs to be considered in analyzing a system with MIPT. We investigate the effect of quantum noise modeled by a reset quantum channel acting on each site with a probability q on MIPT. Based on the numerical results from Clifford circuits, we show that the quantum noise can qualitatively change the entanglement properties - the entanglement obeys “area law” instead of “volume law” with a measurement rate p < pc. In the quantum noise-induced “area law” phase, the entanglement exhibits a novel q−1/3 power-law scaling. Using an analytic mapping from the quantum model to a classical statistical model, we further show that the “area law” entanglement is the consequence of the noise-driven symmetry-breaking field and the q−1/3 scaling can be understood as the result of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fluctuations of the directed polymer with an effective length scale Leff ∼ q−1 in a random environment.",刘铄是清华大学高等研究院三年级博士生，导师为姚宏教授。刘铄2020年毕业于北京师范大学物理学系，获得学士学位。研究方向包括量子多体系统和非平衡物理中的新奇现象。

As an instructive example, we propose extremal black holes (BH) as critical points of a class of gravitational collapses, and find the transition between Continuous Self Similarity (CSS) and Discrete Self Similarity (DSS) behaviours as we tune the parameters of the extremal BH spacetime. In particular, we explicitly show that the DSS solution found here can be interpreted as RG limit cycles, and the transition between CSS and DSS regimes occurs as the stable and unstable fixed points collide and move to the complex plane. We argue that the DSS solutions found in spherically symmetric gravitational collapses can be similarly interpreted. It turns out that various phenomena in non-gravitational systems with RG limit cycles, including DSS correlation function, DSS scaling laws in correlation length and order parameters can also be identified in gravitational critical collapses.",None

How an accurate model can be developed automatically and efficiently from raw sensory inputs (such as images), especially for complex environments and tasks, is a challenging problem that hinders the broad application of MBRL in the real world. Recent developments in differentiable physics-based simulation and rendering provide a potential direction. In this talk, I will introduce a learning framework called SAGCI that leverages differentiable physics simulation to model the environment.

Hot atmospheres and radio jets and lobes are the ingredients of radio-mechanical active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. About half of the most massive early type galaxies harbour multi-phase filamentary gas, which appears to result from the thermally unstable cooling of their hot atmospheres. We will present recent results based on radio and X-ray observations, which indicate that in massive early type galaxies the central radio sources are mostly switched on. We will show that for galaxies with thermally unstable hot atmospheres, the mechanical jet power correlates strongly with the Bondi accretion power. Further investigating the dependence of jet power on individual quantities in the Bondi formula, such as the supermassive black hole mass and the specific entropy of the gas at the Bondi radius, we find a very tight correlation between the jet power and black hole mass and, although poorly constrained, a hint of an anti-correlation between jet power and entropy. The results indicate that at least for thermally unstable systems, the jet power is set primarily by the supermassive black hole mass. The fact that we only see a strong correlation for thermally unstable atmospheres suggests that the black holes producing the jets and lobes are fed by cooling gas from the galactic atmospheres. It appears that once the atmosphere becomes thermally unstable, the cooling gas feeds the black holes in the centres of all galaxies at a similar jet-to-Bondi power ratio, possibly indicating a key universal property of black hole accretion in early-type galaxies. Importantly, since the central black hole mass of X-ray luminous early-type galaxies correlates with the total mass of the host halo, more massive systems undergoing thermally unstable cooling will naturally have larger jet powers.","Norbert Werner is a professor and the leader of the High-Energy Astrophysics research group in the Department of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics at Masaryk University.

Massive spectroscopic surveys are thus carried out to trace the LSS with the 3D positions of galaxies and quasars, as well as the radial distributions of neutral Hydrogen clouds. Recent spectroscopic surveys has collected millions of spectra of galaxies and quasars, and revealed an uninterrupted view of the cosmos over the last 11 billion years. This large dataset permits percent-level measurements of many standard cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant, matter fluctuation amplitude, and dark energy density.
In this talk, the speaker will introduce the design and strategy of the state-of-art spectroscopic surveys, and review the process of obtaining cosmological constraints from the raw data, with the focus on robust estimates of statistical and systematic errors. The speaker will also discuss the prospects of cosmological studies with future surveys, and present forecasts based on the Fisher information matrix.","Cheng Zhao (赵成) received his BSc (2012) and PhD in astrophysics (2018) from Tsinghua University.

Electron microscopy for physicists: From ultimate resolution to quantum states,陈震 清华大学材料学院,2022-11-15 10:00-2022-11-15 11:00,理科楼C302,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9911-1.html,2022-11-15 10:00-2022-11-15 11:00,"Improvements in electron microscopy have provided many new opportunities to explore multiple degrees of freedom in condensed matter physics, well beyond the lattice. Now, we can detect every electron scattered by a sample in both real and momentum space. Using these multidimensional data, we can retrieve the scattering potential of the sample [1], regardless of its nature, such as the electrostatic potential from atoms and magnetic field from spin or even quantum states. In this talk, I will show a successful inversion of the long-standing multiple scattering problem, which was established by H. Bethe in the 1920s. A direct outcome of this inversion is that atoms can be imaged at a resolution mainly limited by the lattice vibration [2]. This new technique also allows for precise measurements of the atomic displacements on a sub-pico-meter scale. I will show one typical example of subtle lattice distortions due to strong electron-lattice coupling in a correlated oxide [3]. I will also show that nanoscale topological spin textures can be imaged at a remarkably high sensitivity and resolution [4]. Finally, I will share my views on the impact of state-of-the-art electron microscopy in condensed matter physics.

Quantum Chaos and Physical Distance Between Quantum States,吴飙 北京大学,2022-11-03 16:00-2022-11-03 17:00,理科楼郑裕彤讲堂,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9893-1.html,2022-11-03 16:00-2022-11-03 17:00,"It has been long argued and accepted that there is no true quantum chaos due to the linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Berry even suggested to change quantum chaos, a confusing oxymoron,  to quantum chaology as the study of quantum systems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaos. We show that there is genuine quantum chaos despite that quantum dynamics is linear. This is revealed by introducing a physical distance between two quantum states. Qualitatively different from existing distances for quantum states, for example, the Fubini-Study distance, the physical distance between two mutually orthogonal quantum states can be very small.  As a result, two quantum states, which are initially very close by physical distance, can diverge from each other during the ensuing quantum dynamical evolution. This kind of sensitivity to initial conditions is reduced to the one in classical dynamics in the semiclassical limit. In the end, we discuss how nonlinear Newton’s equations of motion emerge out of the linear Schrödinger equation.

Perception with Confidence: A Conformal Prediction Perspective,Heng Yang  Harvard University,2022-11-03 10:00-2022-11-03 11:00,Zoom meeting (https://mit.zoom.us/j/94079983299),清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9896-1.html,2022-11-03 10:00-2022-11-03 11:00,"Deep learning has witnessed great success in computer vision, and large-scale data-driven models are becoming prevalent in modern machine perception systems. However, a critical drawback of learned perception modules is that they come with little performance guarantees and are often brittle when deployed in complex environments. Although a growing body of literature is trying to endow deep learning with robustness guarantees, most methods either face scalability limitations or require extra assumptions on the structure of the problem.
In this talk, I advocate conformal prediction as a general and scalable framework to equip black-box perception models with statistical guarantees.
I will first review the statistical machinery of inductive conformal prediction (ICP) that, given a calibration set and a nonconformity function, can convert any learned prediction function into a prediction set that provably covers the true label with a user-specified probability (e.g., 90%) under the mild condition of exchangeability.
I will then present in detail a case study to demonstrate how ICP can be applied to the problem of image-based object detection and pose estimation. In the first stage, with properly designed nonconformity functions, we use ICP to successfully conformalize state-of-the-art keypoint detectors to obtain circular or elliptical prediction sets with guaranteed probabilistic coverage of the true keypoints. In the second stage, we use geometric techniques to propagate the uncertainty in keypoints to derive uncertainty in pose estimation — the result of which is a pose uncertainty set (PURSE) that probabilistically contains the ground truth pose. We demonstrate correct pose estimation and uncertainty quantification on the LineMOD occlusion dataset. I conclude by remarking how this opens up new opportunities in designing perception-based control systems with performance guarantees.

Among them, antiferromagnets hold promise for high-speed, low-power spintronics because they have magnetic resonance frequencies in the terahertz regime, null stray field for vanishing cross-talk between adjacent bits, and robustness against the external magnetic field perturbation. However, there is no good way to probe the magnetic states of the antiferromagnets in the 2D limit, due to their atomic thickness and net vanishing magnetization. In this talk, by means of electrical transport and optical spectroscopy measurements under low temperature and high magnetic field, I will give a few examples to study the magnetic evolution processes of 2D antiferromagnetic materials down to monolayer limit. For example, we detected the subtle phase transition behavior of exfoliated stripy antiferromagnet CrOCl under varying temperature and magnetic field and clarified its controversial spin structure, multiple degrees of freedom coupling of CrOCl under the 2D limit, and unraveled the odd-even layer-number effect and layer-dependent magnetic phase diagrams in A-type anitferromagnet MnBi2Te4.","Yu Ye is an assistant professor in the School of Physics at Peking University.

This problem provides a unified framework for a variety of fundamental tasks in machine learning: generative modeling is about transforming a Gaussian (or other elementary) random variable to realistic data points; domain transfer concerns with transferring data points from one domain to another; optimal transport (OT) solves the more challenging problem of finding a ""best"" transport map that minimizes certain transport cost. Unfortunately, despite the unified view, there lacks an algorithm that can solve the transport mapping problem efficiently in all settings. The existing algorithms need to be developed case by case, and tend to be complicated or computationally expensive.
In this talk, I will show you that the problem can be addressed with a simple and unified algorithm by learning neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs). One of the key ideas is to learn dynamics to efficient transfer between two distributions by traveling along straight paths as much as possible. These methods both simplify and improve over the standard denoising diffusion models: the ODE models learned by our method generate can high quality results with a single discretization step, which is a significant speedup over existing diffusion generative models.

We uncover the essential correspondence between driven noisy quantum evolution and geometric curves described with the Frenet-Serret formulas. In terms of the geometric correspondence, we develop an explicit quantum robust control theory. The theory gives necessary and sufficient conditions of the robust control for given errors, and also offers quantitative measure of control robustness. Based on the analytic theory, we propose and demonstrate a practical framework to construct universal robust quantum gates for realistic qubits.

Symmetry breaking of oxide surfaces and interfaces,"Nini Pryds Technical University of Denmark, Department of Energy Conversion and Storage",2022-10-25 15:00-2022-10-25 16:00,"Zoom Meeting (ID:  972 8539 1284, password: 730841)",清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9846-1.html,2022-10-25 15:00-2022-10-25 16:00,"The wide range of fascinating properties observed in complex oxide continue to attract great interest such as ferro-, piezo- and pyroelectricity. Such richness arises from a strong interaction between the charge, orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Several strategies have been employed to break the lattice symmetry and expand the range of functionalities. Here, I will show how symmetry breaking offers extraordinary opportunities for observing new properties. In one example [1] I will show our results obtained with a stack of ultrathin defective oxide single-crystal layers (Gd2O3-doped CeO2 (CGO) and Er2O3-stabilized δ-Bi2O3 (ESB)) which yield an extraordinary electrostriction that outperforms any reported electrostrictive materials (organic or inorganic compounds). In another examples [2] I will show another recent discovery illustrating the possibility to induce a large piezoelectric response in centrosymmetric oxides. Such a high piezoelectric response from intrinsically nonpiezoelectric materials has not been observed before in centrosymmetric materials. Recently, new methods have been developed to realized freestanding oxide membranes. Inspired by the recent development in freestanding oxide membrane, and as a final example [3], I will show how we took these results to a whole new and unexplored direction – creating for the first time a new platform for assembling these ultrathin transition-metal oxides (TMOs) freestanding membranes and twisting them into artificial heterointerfaces. This collection of possibilities offers unique opportunities for a wide range of rich world and new functionality of complex oxide and their interfaces.

A natural consequence of galaxy mergers is the merger of SMBHs from progenitor galaxies. The mechanism or dynamics that drive SMBHs to merge is unknown due to the lack of observational evidence. In this work, we propose to combine the (future) gravitational wave measurements of SMBH binary merger events with the galaxy merger rate distributions from large-scale surveys/cosmological simulations, to infer the delay time of SMBH binary mergers, as a function of binary mass. The future space-based gravitaitonal wave detector LISA or Tianqin/Taiji is optimal to do this work since it will provide us with the population information of the merging binaries (assuming major mergers) across a wide mass range and almost all redshift space, thanks to the large single to noise ratio. We also test different delay time models associated to various dynamical scenarios via the Bayesian model selection method.","Yun Fang obtained her Ph.D degree in July 2020 from the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by Qing-Guo Huang.

Emergent space-time from a quantum phase transition and its experimental tests in cold atom systems.,Jinwu Ye Mississippi State university/West Lake university,2022-10-14 10:00-2022-10-14 11:00,"Room C109, New Science Building, Tsinghua University",清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9818-1.html,2022-10-14 10:00-2022-10-14 11:00,"P.W. Anderson said "" More is different "". It says the macroscopic quantum phenomena such as superfluids, superconductors, quantum anti-ferromagnetism, fractional quantum Hall states, etc emerge as the number of interacting particles gets more and more. However, he left the question how these emergent quantum or topological phenomena change under different inertial frames. In this colloquium, we try to address this outstanding problem.
We propose there is an emergent space-time corresponding to any emergent quantum phenomenon, especially near a quantum/topological phase transition (QPT).  We demonstrate this new emergent space-time structure by studying one of the simplest QPTs:Superfluid (SF)-Mott transitions of interacting bosons in a square lattice observed in a frame moving with a constant velocity $ v $ relative to the underlaying lattice.
By constructing effective actions and performing microscopic calculations on a lattice, we find that the new emergent space-time leads to several new effects in the moving frame such as the change of the ground state (the Mott phase near the QPT may turn into a SF phase, but not the other way around ), the rising of the KT transition temperature, the change of the condensation momentum, the sign reverse of the Doppler shift in the excitation spectrum relative to the bare velocity $ v $, the emergence of new class of QPTs, etc. Contrast to the Doppler shifts in a relativistic quantum field theory, Unruh effects in an accelerating  observer,emergent curved space-time from the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model are made.
Finally, we show that despite these effects are hard to observe in real materials, but could be detected in cold atoms loaded in an optical lattice.","Prof. Ye received his Ph.D. from Yale University. Now he is a Professor at Mississippi state university. He has been a long term visitor at the Institute for Theoretical Sciences, Westlake University since last Fall.

We realize high-fidelity coherent exchange of single motional quanta between modes – where the timing, strength, and phase of the coupling are controlled through an oscillating electric potential with suitable spatial variation. The coupling rate can be made much larger than the decoherence rates, enabling demonstrations of high-fidelity quantum state transfer, entanglement of motional modes, and Hong-Ou-Mandel-type interference. We demonstrate quantum non-demolition measurement of a quantum state stored in a ‘protected’ motional mode by using high-fidelity swaps.

Scaling of the strange-metal scattering in high-Tc superconductors,金魁 中国科学院物理研究所,2022-10-05 16:00-2022-10-05 17:00,清华大学高等研究院（科学馆）104报告厅,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9783-1.html,2022-10-05 16:00-2022-10-05 17:00,"Soon after the discovery of cuprate superconductors, the strange-metal behavior of their normal-state resistivity was observed, namely, a linear resistivity as a function of temperature (T-linear resistivity) persisting much lower than the Debye temperature. About one decade ago, several groups unveiled an intimated correlation between the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and the slope of the T-linear resistivity (A1). That is, these two quantities increase or decrease simultaneously. Consequently, the question the community has been after is: what connects the strength of superconductivity with electron scattering? To solve this issue, one needs to quantify the relationship between Tc and A1. However, it turns out to be a great challenge to manipulate external parameters for marked evolution of properties with minute changes. In this talk, I would like to share with you two pieces of our recent work and report on the discovery of Tc ~ A10.5 relationship in different families of high-temperature superconductors. For a cuprate system La2-xCexCuO4, we developed advanced high-throughput techniques and used a combinatorial library to map how superconducting properties and normal-state properties of the superconductor evolve with minute compositional variation (Δx) with unprecedented resolution and accuracy . We also achieved continuous evolution of superconductivity in ion-gated FeSe film via electric-field gating technique integrated with two-coil mutual inductance and electrical transport property measurements. Such relationship between Tc and A1 is at work for both systems, yet different techniques were employed to tune the superconductivity minutely. Remarkably, the scaling is seemingly satisfied also in hole-doped cuprate, as well as a class of organic superconductors via pressure tuning. This unexpected universal scale indicates that there is perhaps a common origin of superconductivity in unconventional superconductors.","Kui Jin is the group leader of SC2 team and the deputy director of National Lab for Superconductivity in Institute of Physics (IOP), Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Symmetry control and emergent phenomena in square-lattice iridates,Jian Liu University of Tennessee,2022-10-05 10:00-2022-10-05 11:00,Tencent Meeting (ID: 685-601-826),清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9790-1.html,2022-10-05 10:00-2022-10-05 11:00,"Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a key ingredient of nontrivial band topology in weakly interacting materials. On the other hand, the impact of SOC in strongly correlated systems often manifests in magnetic anisotropy. 5d transition metal oxides offers unique opportunities to explore the SOC-correlation interplay since they have a similar energy scale. A prominent example is the square-lattice iridates which are surprisingly similar to weakly spin-orbit-coupled high-Tc cuprates. To understand this intriguing SOC-correlation interplay, it is necessary to obtain toy-model systems where the interactions can be experimentally tuned by structural engineering of dimensionality, strain, lattice distortion, etc. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work on pseudospin-half square lattices realized in artificial perovskite superlattices as well as the Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Our goal is to enforce various symmetry configurations to controllably enable different emergent behaviors. This allows us to demonstrate control of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations in virtual of the hidden SU(2) symmetry of artificial perovskite superlattices and archive giant magnetic responses probed by resonant x-ray scattering. Signatures of the Slater-Mott crossover regime was also identified. Anisotropic strains of orthogonal symmetry channels were applied to the Ruddlesden-Popper phase to realize metamagnetic switching and induce a rare quartic anisotropy for spatial spin modulation. The results showcase the rich emergent behaviors and functional properties beyond the analogy with cuprates.","Jian Liu obtained his Ph.D. in 2012 from the University of Arkansas and was a doctoral fellow of the Advanced Light Source.

I will theoretically demonstrate this phenomenon in two cases: mean field steering and fluctuation steering. In the first case, we show that in excitonic insulators with s-wave electron-hole pairing, an applied light pulse can induce a p-wave component to the order parameter, and further drive it to rotate in the s+ip plane. In one dimension, each cycle of rotation pumps exactly two electrons across the sample while higher dimensional systems are similar, realizing a Thouless charge pump as a collective manybody effect. In the second case, we study the dynamics of a competing order system which is rapidly heated up by a pump and then cools down. In the cooling process, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations lead the system into the phase associated with the faster-relaxing order parameter, which is not necessarily the ground state. This theory offers a natural explanation for the widespread experimental observation that metastable states may be induced by laser pulses.

However, their working largely remains a mystery; classical learning theory cannot explain why pre-training on an unsupervised task can help many different downstream tasks. This talk will first investigate the role of pre-training losses in extracting meaningful structural information from unlabeled data, especially in the infinite data regime. Concretely, I will show that the contrastive loss can give rise to embeddings whose Euclidean distance captures the manifold distance between raw data (or, more generally, the graph distance of a so-called positive-pair graph). Moreover, directions in the embedding space correspond to relationships between clusters in the positive-pair graph. Then, I will discuss two other elements that seem necessary for a sharp explanation of the behavior of practical pre-trained models:  inductive bias of architectures and implicit bias of optimizers. I will introduce two recent, ongoing projects, where we (1) strengthen the previous theoretical framework by incorporating the inductive bias of architectures and (2) demonstrate the implicit bias of optimizers in pre-training, even with infinite pre-training data, empirically and theoretically.","Tengyu Ma is an assistant professor of Computer Science and Statistics at Stanford University.

The theory describes the onset of Ising order in a Fermi liquid, and closely related theories apply to other cases with critical Fermi surfaces. Inspired by SYK models, we employ random couplings in flavorspace between the fermions and the bosonic order parameter, but there is no spatial randomness: consequently, the G-Σ path integral of the theory is expressed in terms of fields bilocal in spacetime. We show by transport calculations that this first theory realizes a non-Fermi liquid but not a strange metal due to various cancellations related to momentum conservation. Next, we consider a theory with spatiallyrandom disorder, and demonstratethat it realizes a marginal Fermi liquid but not a strange metal. Finally, we propose that a strange metal can be realized by a theory with spatially random Yukawa interactions.",None

Concentration of quantum equilibration and an estimate of the recurrence time,Alvaro Alhambra Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics,2022-07-20 20:00-2022-07-20 21:00,"Zoom meeting (ID: 829 4126 0071, password: 376291)",清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9688-1.html,2022-07-20 20:00-2022-07-20 21:00,"The dynamics of large quantum systems is currently an active topic of research due to the great progress on experimental setups. These dynamics appear to often obey certain universal features, consistent with the principles of statistical mechanics. One of the more prominent ones is equilibration: despite the inherent unitarity and reversibility, the evolution appears to converge to a fixed equilibrium value for very long times, until Poincaré recurrences happen.
Here, we show that this equilibration happens in a more dramatic way than previously thought: we prove that the dynamics of generic quantum systems concentrate around their equilibrium value when measuring at arbitrary times. This means that the probability of finding them away from equilibrium is exponentially suppressed, with a decay rate given by the effective dimension, which is itself exponential in system size. Our result allows us to place a lower bound on the recurrence time of quantum systems, since recurrences corresponds to the rare events of finding a state away from equilibrium. In many-body systems, this bound is doubly exponential in system size. We also show corresponding results for free fermions, which display a weaker concentration and earlier recurrences.","Alvaro Alhambra is a postdoctoral researcher and Humboldt Fellow at Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics.

The talk is positioned on the above three points and introduces the following innovative results. First of all, I am going to elaborate on a practical protocol, the basis-biased four-six-state protocol which has been experimentally demonstrated via an entanglement source by SPDC. It is theoretically and experimentally confirmed that the protocol can effectively resist the influence of the rotating channel. Thus, the problem of frequent calibration of the measurement frame of the BB84 protocol in free space could be solved. Secondly, a standardized security analysis framework based on the four-six state protocol demonstration experimental system is put forward. It transforms the practical security analysis problem into the operator processing problem.

Our proposal reformulates the bipartite entanglement detection as a two-player zero-sum game completed by parameterized quantum circuits, where a two-outcome measurement can be used to query a classical binary result about whether the input state is bipartite entangled or not. In principle, for an $N$-qubit quantum state, the runtime complexity of our proposal is $O(poly(N)T)$ with $T$ being the number of iterations. We experimentally implement our protocol on a linear optical network and exhibit its effectiveness to accomplish the bipartite entanglement detection for 5-qubit quantum pure states and 2-qubit quantum mixed states.

However, the extremely high accuracy needed to surpass classical computers poses a critical demand to the circuit depth, which is severely limited by the non-negligible gate infidelity, currently around 0.1-1%. Here, by incorporating a virtual Heisenberg circuit, which acts effectively on the measurement observables, to a real shallow Schrödinger circuit, which is implemented realistically on the quantum hardware, we propose a paradigm of Schrödinger-Heisenberg variational quantum algorithms to resolve this problem. We choose a Clifford virtual circuit, whose effect on the Hamiltonian can be efficiently and classically implemented according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Yet, it greatly enlarges the state expressivity, realizing much larger unitary t-designs. Our method enables accurate quantum simulation and computation that otherwise is only achievable with much deeper and more accurate circuits conventionally. This has been verified in our numerical experiments for a better approximation of random states and a higher-fidelity solution to the ground state energy of the XXZ model.

Optimization extends the feasibility of quantum error mitigation,Dayue Qin China Academy of Engineering physics,2022-01-12 19:15-2022-01-12 20:30,"MMW S327 + Tencent Meeting (ID: 419-413-213, password: 1984）",清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9451-1.html,2022-01-12 19:15-2022-01-12 20:30,"The ultimate goal of quantum computing is to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC), where the number of qubits is sufficiently large and the error rate is satisfactorily low, such that quantum algorithms concatenating quantum error correction can outperform classical computers on certain computing tasks. In the middle way towards FTQC, there is an era of intermediate-scale quantum computing (NISQ) where error correction fails due to the error threshold and insufficient number of qubits. However, it is believed that NISQ devices can perform computations with practical uses and quantum advantage on NISQ devices have already been experimentally demonstrated. To make NISQ devices being useful, attempts in several aspects have been making, such as short-depth quantum algorithms, encoding a quantum simulation problem with smaller number of qubits and quantum error mitigation etc. In this talk, the author focuses on error mitigation. In a nutshell, error mitigation performs computations on variant circuits and then use post process to estimate the computation result with a relative low error. The post process can be either coherent such as that in virtual distillation, or classical such as those in error extrapolation, probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and subspace expansion.
Learning-based quantum error mitigation can extend the feasibility of PEC to large quantum circuits with correlated errors. Conventional PEC obtains the quasi-probability according to the result of gate-set tomography whose resource cost is unacceptable in large quantum circuit. In Learning-based PEC, we represent the quasi-probability with efficient ansatzes and train them to the optimal. The training data is obtained by substituting general unitary gates with Clifford gates. Our demonstration shows the advantage of learning-based PEC in efficacy and accuracy. Generally, the methodology of optimization can be concatenated with kinds of error mitigation strategies and improve their performance. More importantly, for a quantum circuit with O(N) gates prone to errors, the bias after optimized error mitigation is reduce by a large factor of O(\sqrt N), which indicate the scalability of error mitigation.","Dayue Qin (秦大粤) graduated and received his bachelor degree from school of physics and technology, Wuhan University in 2018.

While scalable approaches, such as cycle benchmarking, are known for special classes of quantum circuits, the characterization of noise in general circuits with non-Clifford gates has been an unreachable task. We develop an algorithm that can sample-efficiently estimate the total amount of noise induced by a layer of arbitrary non-Clifford gates, including all crosstalks, and experimentally demonstrate the method on IBM Quantum hardware. Our algorithm is inspired by Google's quantum supremacy experiment and is based on random circuit sampling. In their paper, Google observed that their experimental linear cross entropy was consistent with a simple uncorrelated noise model, and claimed this coincidence indicated that the noise in their device was uncorrelated -- a key step in hardware development towards fault tolerance. As an application, we show that our result provides formal evidence to support such a conclusion.","Yunchao Liu is a third-year PhD student in the Theory Group at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Umesh Vazirani.

In this talk, I will introduce two quantum algorithms that we recently developed for convex optimization and nonconvex optimization, respectively. Both achieve polynomial quantum speedup compared to the best-known classical algorithms. Our quantum algorithms are built upon two techniques: First, we replace the classical perturbations in gradient descent methods by simulating quantum wave equations, which constitutes the polynomial speedup in $n$ for escaping from saddle points. Second, we show how to use a quantum gradient computation algorithm due to Jordan to replace the classical gradient queries by quantum evaluation queries with the same complexity.

However, current numerical methods are based on some assumptions such as working in asymptotic limit and collective attacks from eavesdroppers. In this work, we remove these assumptions and develop an unconditional numerical security analysis for general QKD protocols.

We demonstrate its applications in cooling an arbitrary input state with known ground state energy, corresponding to satisfactory, linear algebra tasks, and quantum state compiling tasks, and preparing unknown eigenvalues and eigenstates, corresponding to quantum many-body problems. Compared to quantum phase estimation, our method uses only one ancillary qubit and much shallower circuits, showing exponential improvement of the circuit complexity with respect to the final state infidelity. We numerically benchmark the algorithms for the $8$-qubit Heisenberg model and verify its feasibility for accurately finding eigenenergies and obtaining eigenstate measurements. Our work paves the way for efficient and universal quantum algorithmic cooling with near-term as well as universal fault-tolerant quantum devices.","Pei Zeng is currently a Postdoc scholar at the University of Chicago.

By applying tensor network representation and combinational counting, we analytically show that the average subsystem purity and entanglement entropy for the two ensembles feature the same volume law, but greatly differ in typicality, namely the purity fluctuation is small and universal for the CCZ ensemble while it is large for the CZ ensemble.

Our proof is based on the resource-theoretic formalism of thermodynamics and the quantum ergodic theorem. The complete thermodynamic potential is in general given by a quantity called the spectral divergence rate, while under some assumptions it reduces to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate.

(2) Gravity is ""holographic"": a gravitational system can be recast as a one-lower-dimensional field theory without gravity. (3) The structure of gravity, perhaps its very essense, appears deeply rooted in quantum information theory, cf. Hawking's conclusion that a black hole's entropy is its surface area. Statement (3) suggests a strategy to address problem (1) and understand gravity: to examine information theoretic properties of the holographic descriptions of gravity stipulated in (2). That is, we ask what is special about gravity, and look for answers in quantum information theory using holography. It turns out that the gravitational interpretation imposes a set of novel inequalities on von Neumann entropies of reduced states; such inequalities are set to delimit the ""holographic entropy cone."" I will review known facts about the cone (work by others, going back to 2015) and sketch recent progress on this question, done in my group here at Tsinghua.

We report our recent fluxonium qubit with coherence time reaching T2*= 1.48±0.13 ms [1], which exceeds the state of the art value by an order of magnitude.  As a result, the average single-qubit gate fidelity grew above 0.9999, surpassing, to our knowledge, any other solid-state quantum system. To make fluxonium-base quantum processors possible, we investigate two-qubit gate schemes in fluxonium systems. In superconducting circuits, the weak anharmonicity of transmons creates many design challenges, leading to more complex circuits and pulse protocols, slower gates, and higher gate errors. Here we describe a minimalistic scheme to control interactions between strongly-anharmonic fluxonium qubits, connected by a permanent capacitive link. The two qubit gate can be realized with near-resonant driving [2] or off-resonant driving [3] of non-computational transitions in either qubit. The same mechanism can be applied to cancel the static ZZ interaction. The measured gate error less than 0.01 is limited by decoherence, which will likely improve in the next generation devices. Our demonstration generally applies to strongly-anharmonic qubits, and it opens a new route for reducing errors and increasing circuit depth of quantum algorithms executed on fluxonium-based processors.

The skin effect discovered recently in non-hermitian systems reveals the sensitivity to the spatial boundary condition even deeply in bulk. In this letter, we show that these two seemingly different phenomena can be unified through space-time duality. The intuition is that the space-time duality maps unitary dynamics to non-unitary dynamics and exchanges the temporal direction and spatial direction. Therefore, the space-time duality can establish the connection between the sensitivity to the initial condition in the temporal direction and the sensitivity to the boundary condition in the spatial direction. Here we demonstrate this connection by studying the space-time duality of the out-of-time-ordered commutator in a concrete chaotic hermitian model. We show that the out-of-time-ordered commutator is mapped to a special two-point correlator in a non-hermitian system in the dual picture. For comparison, we show that this sensitivity disappears when the non-hermiticity is removed in the dual picture.",None

Combating Concurrency Bugs in Go Software Systems,Linhai Song Pennsylvania State University,2021-05-08 14:00-2021-05-08 16:00,FIT 1-222,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9233-1.html,2021-05-08 14:00-2021-05-08 16:00,"Go is a statically-typed programming language that aims to provide a simple, efficient, and safe way to build concurrent programs. To achieve its design purpose, Go recommends passing messages using channels as a less error-prone means of thread communication and provides several new concurrency mechanisms and libraries to ease multi-threading programming. Since its creation in 2009, Go has become increasingly popular and has already been adopted to build many important infrastructure software systems. Unfortunately, concurrency bugs, especially those due to misuse of channels, exist widely in Go. Those bugs severely hurt the reliability of Go software systems.
In this talk, I will present our recent research work on fighting Go concurrency bugs. We first empirically studied 171 concurrency bugs from six popular Go software, including Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC to compare message passing and share memory synchronization. Inspired by the study, we then built a static concurrency bug detection system, GCatch, to effectively identify block bugs due to misuse of channels. After disentangling an input Go program, GCatch models the complex channel operations in Go using a novel constraint system and applies a constraint solver to pinpoint blocking bugs. A blocking bug continues to hurt the system’s reliability until it is fixed. Thus, we built an automated concurrency bug fixing system, GFix, for patching blocking bugs detected by GCatch. GFix synthesizes patches with good readability and performance using Go’s channel-related language features. In total, GCatch finds 149 previously unknown blocking bugs due to misuse of channels in real Go software systems and GFix successfully fixes 124 of them. We have reported all detected bugs and generated patches to developers. So far, developers have fixed 125 bugs based on our reporting. Among them, 87 bugs are fixed by applying GFix’s patches directly.","Linhai Song is an assistant professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University.

Optimal rates for independence testing via permutation tests,Tom Berrett University of Warwick,2021-04-06 16:00-2021-04-06 17:30,Online,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9182-1.html,2021-04-06 16:00-2021-04-06 17:30,"Independence testing is one of the most well-studied problems in statistics, and the use of procedures such as the chi-squared test is ubiquitous in the sciences. While tests have traditionally been calibrated through asymptotic theory, permutation tests are experiencing a growth in popularity due to their simplicity and exact Type I error control. In this talk I will present new, finite-sample results on the power of a new class of permutation tests, which show that their power is optimal in many interesting settings, including those with discrete, continuous, and functional data. A simulation study shows that our test for discrete data can significantly outperform the chi-squared for natural data-generating distributions.
 
Defining a natural measure of dependence $D(f)$ to be the squared $L^2$-distance between a joint density $f$ and the product of its marginals, we first show that there is generally no valid test of independence that is uniformly consistent against alternatives of the form $\{​​f: D(f) \geq \rho^2 \}​​$. Motivated by this observation, we restrict attention to alternatives that satisfy additional Sobolev-type smoothness constraints, and consider as a test statistic a U-statistic estimator of $D(f)$. Using novel techniques for studying the behaviour of U-statistics calculated on permuted data sets, we prove that our tests can be minimax optimal. Finally, based on new normal approximations in the Wasserstein distance for such permuted statistics, we also provide an approximation to the power function of our permutation test in a canonical example, which offers several additional insights.

Succinct Blind Quantum Computation Using a Random Oracle,Jiayu Zhang Boston University,2021-03-25 14:00-2021-03-25 15:30,FIT1-202,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-9178-1.html,2021-03-25 14:00-2021-03-25 15:30,"In the universal blind quantum computation problem, a client wants to make use of a single quantum server to evaluate ‍‍ where ‍‍ is an arbitrary quantum circuit while keeping ‍‍ secret. The client’s goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi, has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions). In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, BFK), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical — it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol’s first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter ‍‍, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of ‍‍, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of . In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.","Jiayu Zhang is currently a Ph.D student in Boston University, advised by Prof. Adam Smith.

These tasks' objectives often correlate, conflict, or compete with each other, making it impossible to find a single globally optimal solution. Therefore, there has been a strong interest in discovering multiple solutions with varying trade-offs across different objectives, known as the Pareto fronts. However, most existing works explore finite, discrete, and sparse Pareto fronts only. In this talk, I will present two of our recent papers about efficiently discovering locally continuous Pareto fronts in machine learning applications. We first show that by leveraging Krylov subspace methods and Pareto optimality conditions, we can efficiently find continuous Pareto optimal solutions in large-scale multi-task learning applications [1]. Next, we will extend this topic to deep reinforcement learning and show we can reconstruct a family of continuous Pareto optimal controllers for robots with a prediction-guided network [2]. I will conclude the talk by proposing a few future research directions that explore continuous Pareto fronts in other deep-learning research frontiers, including Neural Architecture Search (NAS), Meta-Learning, and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).

This is achieved by considering measurement of the non-Hermitian annihilation operator from an information-theoretic perspective. This measure, apart from capturing the idea of nonclassicality as quantum uncertainty in a succinct way, is mathematically computable and physically intuitive. We investigate its fundamental properties, and illustrate its physical applications in quantifying nonclassicality of quantum states. We compare it with various existent measures of nonclassicality and illustrate its merits. A related measure of classicality, which is in some sense dual to nonclassicality, is also introduced.

However, is a good representation itself sufficient for efficient reinforcement learning? This question is largely unexplored, and the extant body of literature mainly focuses on conditions which permit efficient reinforcement learning with little understanding of what are necessary conditions for efficient reinforcement learning. This work provides strong negative results for reinforcement learning methods with function approximation for which a good representation (feature extractor) is known to the agent, focusing on natural representational conditions relevant to value-based learning and policy-based learning. For value-based learning, we show that even if the agent has a highly accurate linear representation, the agent still needs to sample exponentially many trajectories in order to find a near-optimal policy. For policy-based learning, we show even if the agent's linear representation is capable of perfectly representing the optimal policy, the agent still needs to sample exponentially many trajectories in order to find a near-optimal policy. These lower bounds highlight the fact that having a good (value-based or policy-based) representation in and of itself is insufficient for efficient reinforcement learning.","Ruosong Wang is currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov.

Where to next with first-order optimization?【IIIS-Haihua Distinguished Seminar Series in Artificial Intelligence】,Chris Maddison the Insitute for Advanced Study in Princeton,2019-12-26 15:30-2019-12-26 16:30,FIT Lecture Hall,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-8318-1.html,2019-12-26 15:30-2019-12-26 16:30,"First-order methods for numerical optimization are central to modern machine learning, due to their scalability and simplicity. In this talk we explore their theory and practice by re-considering traditional assumptions and common wisdom. First, we introduce a descent method that converges under a novel generalization of Lipschitz smoothness, which is a ubiquitous assumption in the analysis of first-order methods. Our method is a non-linear preconditioning of gradient descent, and we show how this method can be applied to p-norm regression and exponential penalty function minimization. Second, we demonstrate the sensitivity of optimizer comparisons to the metaparameter tuning protocol. As tuning effort grows without bound, more general update rules should never underperform the ones they can approximate (i.e., Adam should never perform worse than momentum), but the recent attempts to compare optimizers for deep learning either assume these inclusion relationships are not relevant in practice or restrict the metaparameters they tune to break the inclusions. In our experiments, we find that the inclusion relationships between optimizers matter in practice and always predict optimizer comparisons. In particular, we find that the popular adative gradient methods never underperform momentum or gradient descent, a challenge to commonly held wisdom.","Chris Maddison is member at the Insitute for Advanced Study in Princeton in the Special Year on Theoretical Machine Learning, and he will be joining the Departments of Computer Science and Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and the Vector Institute as an assistant professor in July 2020.

In this talk, we propose a general resource framework for quantum channels and introducing resource monotones based on general distance quantifiers of channels. We study the interplay between channel and state resource theories by relating resource monotones of a quantum channel to its manipulation power of the state resource. Regarding channels as operational resources, we introduce asymptotic channel distillation and dilution, the most important tasks in an operational resource theory, and show how to bound the conversion rates with channel resource monotones. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the characterization and benchmark of quantum memories. We introduce the robustness of quantum memory, and demonstrate its operational meaning as a resource in three different settings: (1) the resource cost of synthesising the memory with idealised qubit memories, (2) the resource cost of simulating the memory's observational statistics with classical resources, and (3) the performance of the memory in discriminating different input states.

Architects need to understand the potential performance benefits of new techniques as well as the energy- and power-trade-offs that need to be made to accelerate general-purpose workloads. This becomes increasingly important as datacenters continue to grow size, IoT devices proliferate, and as designers consider open-source solutions as an alternative to commercial ones. The number of potential architects is increasing overall, but their tools have-not been keeping pace.Building enhanced processors takes a significant amount of time and effort and the cycle-level, detailed simulation needed to predict simulator performance can be 1000x to 10,000x slower than real-time execution. We cannot wait for others to build this promising future of high-performance, energy-efficient designs. What is needed are techniques to significantly speed up the design of these new, promising designs, while maintaining accuracy and generality. Many solutions have been proposed to help solve this bottleneck, such as analytical modeling, and even FPGA-based acceleration. But, many of these techniques are unable to keep up with the complexity, the number of processors in the system, or the features that those methodologies can simulate. Other techniques restrict the type of changes that can be investigated or complexity of the workload. In the end, we need flexible solutions that allow for scalability and flexibility, while maintaining simulation performance.In this talk, we detail our latest work on hardware virtualization-accelerated simulation that attempts to address many of these issues.

This paper suggests that the phenomenon may be due to Batch Normalization or BN, which is ubiquitous and provides benefits in optimization and generalization across all standard architectures. The following new results are shown about BN with weight decay and momentum (in other words, the typical use case which was not considered in earlier theoretical analyses of stand-alone BN. Training can be done using SGD with momentum and an exponentially increasing learning rate schedule, i.e., learning rate increases by some (1 + α) factor in every epoch for some α > 0.  To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a rate schedule has been successfully used, let alone for highly successful architectures. As expected, such training rapidly blows up network weights, but the net stays well-behaved due to normalization. Mathematical explanation of the success of the above rate schedule: a rigorous proof that it is equivalent to the standard setting of BN + SGD + Standard Rate Tuning + Weight Decay + Momentum. This equivalence holds for other normalization layers as well, Group Normalization, Layer Normalization, Instance Norm, etc.  A worked-out toy example illustrating the above linkage of hyperparameters.

Then investigate automatically designing small and fast models (ProxylessNAS, ICLR’19), auto channel pruning (AMC, ECCV’18), and auto mixed-precision quantization (HAQ, CVPR’19). We demonstrate such learning-based, automated design achieves superior performance and efficiency than rule-based human design. Finally, we accelerate computation-intensive AI applications including TSM (ICCV’19) for efficient video recognition and PVCNN (NeurIPS’19) for efficient 3D point cloud recognition.","Song Han is an assistant professor at MIT EECS.

Ultra-wide Neural Nets and Neural Tangent Kernel【IIIS-Haihua Distinguished Seminar Series in Artificial Intelligence】,Simon Shaolei Du  Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton,2019-10-31 14:00-2019-10-31 15:00,FIT Lecture Hall,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-8256-1.html,2019-10-31 14:00-2019-10-31 15:00,"The optimization and generalization of neural networks are still like mysteries. Simple gradient methods can find global minima of a highly non-convex loss function, and neural networks can generalize well despite being highly over-parameterized. In the first part of the talk, I will show the connection between ultra-wide neural networks and kernel methods with a particular kernel function: neural tangent kernel (NTK) and use this connection to explain the optimization and generalization behavior of neural networks. Furthermore, I will show how NTK can help us understand the benefit of certain layers in neural network architecture. In the second part of the talk, I will show NTK itself can be useful in practice. In several settings, including categorical data classification, graph classification, and few-shot learning, NTK enjoys the superior empirical performance.","Simon Shaolei Du is a postdoc at Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton, hosted by Sanjeev Arora.

Memory-Efficient Search Trees for Database Management Systems,Huanchen Zhang  Carnegie Mellon University,2019-10-25 14:00-2019-10-25 15:00,FIT 1-222,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-8237-1.html,2019-10-25 14:00-2019-10-25 15:00,"The growing cost gap between DRAM and storage together with increasing database sizes means that database management systems (DBMSs) now operate with a lower memory to storage size ratio than before. On the other hand, modern DBMSs rely on in-memory search trees (e.g., indexes and filters) to achieve high throughput and low latency. These search trees, however, consume a large portion of the total memory available to the DBMS. In this talk, we address the challenge of building compact yet fast in-memory search trees to allow more efficient use of memory in data processing systems. We first present techniques to reduce the memory of a read-optimized search tree to the theoretical limit without compromising its query performance. We then introduce ways to amortize the cost of modifying static data structures with bounded and modest cost in performance and space. Finally, we approach the search tree compression problem from an orthogonal direction by building a fast order-preserving key compressor. Together, these three pieces form a practical recipe for achieving memory-efficiency in search trees and in DBMSs.","Huanchen Zhang is a final-year Ph.D. student advised by David G.

"Curriculum, Evolution and Emergent Complexity with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",Yi Wu  OpenAI Inc.,2019-10-24 15:00-2019-10-24 16:00,FIT 1-222,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-8241-1.html,2019-10-24 15:00-2019-10-24 16:00,"The theory of evolution was introduced in Darwin’s book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, which states that the organisms on Earth are evolved through natural selection over a diverse population according to their adaptabilities to environmental changes. This evolution process eventually brings us, humans, who possess intelligence.
We observe similar evolutionary phenomena for artificial agents trained by deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments, where agents compete/collaborate, co-evolve jointly and eventually learn complex skills and strategies resembling human behavior. We believe such an observation provides a significant indication of the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
Particularly, two recent advances will be covered in this talk. In the first part, we will show that by simple hide-and-seek rules, agents naturally evolve in an open-ended physical world via self-play. This evolution process acts as an auto-curriculum and leads to 6 emergent phases of learned strategies with tool-use skills. In the second part, we will introduce a learning paradigm, Evolutionary Population Curriculum (EPC), which scales multi-agent reinforcement learning through an evolutionary process. EPC starts from just a few agents and progressively evolves the agents to harder environments with exponentially growing populations.","Yi Wu is now a researcher in the multi-agent team at OpenAI Inc. and will join the institute of interdisciplinary information sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University, as an assistant professor in 2020 summer.

Demand Response Programs for Workload Scheduling in Data Centers,Vincent Wong  University of British Columbia,2019-10-22 14:00-2019-10-22 15:00,FIT 1-515,清华大学,https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/show-8238-1.html,2019-10-22 14:00-2019-10-22 15:00,"The issue of energy efficiency poses a crucial challenge to today’s data centers owing to the growing requirements for data storage and analysis services. Data centers often support a range of delay-tolerant workloads with adjustable execution time under a service level agreement. This potential for workload management has motivated utility companies to deploy demand response programs to encourage data centers toward shifting workload execution away from peak load periods. However, deployment of a demand response program for data centers is challenging as there is always uncertainty in the arrival rate of workload, the local renewable generation (e.g., photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines), and electricity price (e.g., in a real-time pricing scheme). The uncertainties require a dynamic provisioning of servers to optimally schedule the workload. In this talk, we will discuss how data centers can benefit from participating in demand response programs. We will focus on data centers demand response in deregulated electricity markets, where a data center can enter a contract with one of several competing utility companies. The joint decision of utility company choices and workload scheduling will be captured as a many-to-one matching game with externalities and a distributed algorithm will be developed to determine a stable outcome of such a game. Finally, we will discuss how online convex optimization techniques can be applied to obtain a local optimal workload scheduling for data centers in a demand response program without any knowledge of the stochastic process that uncertain parameters follow.","Vincent Wong is a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.
